# Disney+ Roku

This is my submission for the take home coding assignment. This app shows a grid of Disney+ content that allows the user to navigate through and click on any content for more details.

## Running the app

1. Download [out/roku-deploy.zip](https://github.com/wynnethepooh/disney-roku/blob/main/out/roku-deploy.zip)
2. Follow the steps in [Activating developer mode](https://developer.roku.com/en-gb/docs/developer-program/getting-started/developer-setup.md) to enable developer mode on your device and sideload the ZIP file containing the sample onto it.
